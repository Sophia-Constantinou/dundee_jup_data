training/ 
     - directory with training set. 
training/1,2,3,4,5,6,7
     - directory with training sub-set (for 7 fold cross-validation).

Each sequence is represented by:
     *.fasta file - file with sequence ID and sequence itself.
     *.profile - PSI-BLAST profile for the sequence built using UniRef90, release 2014_07, 09-Jul-2014
     *.dssp - DSSP information (translated into 3-state)
     *.jnet - JNet results

JNet results details:
     JNETPRED        - Final secondary structure prediction for query
     JNETCONF        - Jnet reliability of prediction accuracy, ranges from 0 to 9, bigger is better.
     JNETSOL25	     - Jnet prediction of burial, less than 25% solvent accesibility
     JNETSOL5	     - Jnet prediction of burial, less than 5% exposure
     JNETSOL0	     - Jnet prediction of burial, 0% exposure
     JNETHMM	     - HMM-based (HMMer profile) secondary structure prediction for query
     JNETPSSM	     - PSSM-based (PSI-BLAST profile) secondary structure prediction for query
     JNETJURY	     - Jury details when JNETHMM and JNETPSSM differ
