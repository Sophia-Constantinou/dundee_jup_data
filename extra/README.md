Useful files are in:







# jupyter
Extra notebooks I used:

TrueSS: notebook I used to get true -- ended up using ProIntVar so this is pretty much useless
scop: i briefly considered saving files with scop id instead of pdb and tried it out but didn't end up doing it that way
SCOP_stats: used files from scop to calculate stats
Align: previous version of align notebook
plot: Used this to plot some different versions and compare

stas copy
stats_morepdb: 
I use this notebook to get the final stats
Merge prointvar (choose correct chain) with AF, then add Jpred,saving all different pdb id versions
Get pdb id's that have identical sequences and compare predictions (calculate accuracy, scatter plot etc)
Use z-score to get rid of outliers
